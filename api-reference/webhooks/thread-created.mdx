title: 'Thread created'
---

This event is fired when a new thread is created in your workspace.

You can subscribe to this event **if you want to build an auto-responder**. To do so, when you receive this event, use the `replyToThread` mutation to send a reply back to the customer.

<Warning>
  Every email you receive in your workspace is linked to a thread. If we cannot find a matching
  thread for an email, we will create one. When this happens, you may receive two events:
  `thread.thread_created` and
  [`thread.email_received`](/api-reference/webhooks/thread-email-received) (depending on your
  webhook target event subscriptions). In order to avoid replying to the same thread twice if you
  subscribe to both events, please check the `isStartOfThread` field in the
  [`thread.email_received`](/api-reference/webhooks/thread-email-received) payload.
</Warning>
