title: 'Email received'
---

This event is fired when an email is received in your workspace.

<Warning>
  An important field that might go unnoticed is `isStartOfThread` which tells you if this email is
  the first message of a thread or not. This is useful if you want to build some auto-reply logic
  but note that this will only work for responding to threads received via email. If you want to
  reply to all threads (including Slack messages and anything received via the API) please check
  [`thread.thread_created`](/api-reference/webhooks/thread-created) instead.
</Warning>
