title: 'Create a customer card'
description: 'Define the details of the customer card.'

To create a customer card head to **Settings** → **Customer cards** and enter the following details:

- **Title**: this will be displayed as the title of the card so even if the card fails to load users know which card is
  errored.
- **Key**: the link between this config and your API. A key can only contain alphanumeric, hyphen, and underscore characters (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`)
- **Default time to live (seconds)**: by default how long Plain should cache customer cards. The minimum is 15 seconds, maximum is 1 year in seconds (31536000 seconds).
- **URL**: the URL of your API endpoint that will be built to return customer cards. It must start with `https://`.
- **Headers (optional)**: the headers Plain should pass along when making the request. While this is optional it is
  **highly recommended** to add authorization headers or other tokens that authenticate the request as your API may be
  returning customer data.

<Note>
To get you started quickly, we've created a few example customer cards that you can configure and see how they look in your application. All example cards are available in our open-source repository:
[team-plain/example-customer-cards](https://github.com/team-plain/example-customer-cards)

Here is one you can try right now:

- Title: e.g. "Usage"
- Key: `usage`
- Default time to live: `120`
- URL: https://example-customer-cards.plain.com/
