title: 'Reply to threads'

You can reply to a thread using the `replyToThread` mutation. This will work regardless if the last email in the thread is from a user or a customer.

If it is not possible to reply to this thread, you will get the mutation error code [`cannot_reply_to_thread`](/api-reference/graphql/error-codes#cannot_reply_to_thread) and a message indicating why.
