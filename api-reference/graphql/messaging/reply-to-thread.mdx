You can reply to a thread using the `replyToThread` mutation. The call to this mutation will be successful if:

- the last message in the thread is an email from the customer OR
- the thread was just created with [`createThread`](/api-reference/graphql/threads/create)

If it is not possible to reply to this thread, you will get the mutation error code [`cannot_reply_to_thread`](/api-reference/graphql/error-codes#cannot_reply_to_thread) and a message indicating why.
