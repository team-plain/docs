Plain automatically derives a customer's company for you, but you can also update it manually.

The customer in question is identified by their id (ie `c_...`).

With regards to the company, you can either specify an existing company using the ID we've generated (ie `co_...`), or pass the company domain, which we'll use to derive the rest of the company's info.

If you wish to only remove the customer's associated company, then you can pass `null` as the `companyIdentifier`.

For this mutation you need the following permissions:

- `customer:edit`
