Tenants allow you to structure your customers in Plain in the same way as they are structured in your product.

For example if within your product customers are organised in a 'team' then you would create one tenant per team in your product. A tenant has an `externalId` so that you can map it back to an entity in your database.

Customers can belong to multiple tenants.

For advanced integrations with Plain you can specify a tenant when creating a thread. This is useful when building a support portal in your product as it allows you to fetch threads specific to a team in your product.

Additionally [tiers and SLAs](/tiers/) can be associated with a tenant.
