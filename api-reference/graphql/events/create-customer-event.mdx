title: 'Create a customer event'
---

<Info>
  A customer event will be created in all threads that belong to the provided customer ID. If you
  want an event to appear in a specific thread use a [thread
  event](/api-reference/graphql/events/create-thread-event).
</Info>

To create an event you need a customer ID.

You can get this by [upserting a customer](/api-reference/graphql/customers/upsert) in Plain, from data in webhooks or other API calls you made. If you want to test this, press **⌘ + K** on any thread and then "Copy customer ID" to get an ID you can experiment with.

In this example we'll be creating the following event:

    For this you'll need an API key with the following permissions:
    - `customerEvent:create`
    - `customerEvent:read`
    - `customer:read`

    <Snippet  file="typescript-sdk/create-customer-event.mdx"/>

    Which would console.log:

    <Snippet  file="typescript-sdk/create-customer-event-response.mdx"/>
