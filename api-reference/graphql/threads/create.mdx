title: 'Create threads'
---

Creating a thread is useful in scenarios where you want to programatically start a support interaction.

You can do this in many different scenarios but the most common use-cases are when a contact form is submitted or when you want to provide proactive support off the back of some event or error happening in your product.

A thread is created with an initial 'message' composed out of [UI components](/api-reference/ui-components). You have full control over the structure and appearance of the message in Plain.

To create a thread you need a `customerId`. You can get a customer id by [creating the customer](/api-reference/graphql/customers/upsert) in Plain first.

      Since the Typescript SDK expands a lot of fields you will need an API key with the following permissions:

      - `label:create`
      - `label:read`
      - `labelType:read`
      - `machineUser:read`
      - `customer:read`
      - `user:read`
      - `thread:create`
      - `thread:edit`
      - `thread:read`
