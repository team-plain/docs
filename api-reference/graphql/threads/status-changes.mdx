title: 'Changing status'
---

Threads can be in one of 3 statuses:

- `Todo`
- `Snoozed`
- `Done`

When you log into Plain you can filter threads by these statuses.

When threads are created they default to `Todo`.

To change a threads status you need an API key with the following permissions:

- `thread:edit`
- `thread:read`

### Mark thread as `Done`

When any activity happens in a thread, it will move back to `Todo`.

Unlike traditional ticketing software, we expect a ticket to move between `Todo` and `Done` a number of times in the course of helping a customer. This will not break or influence any metrics. `Done` in Plain means "I'm done for now, there is nothing left for me to do".

### Snooze thread

You can snooze threads for a duration of time defined in seconds.

When any activity happens in a thread, it will be automatically unsnoozed and move to `Todo`. Otherwise threads will be unsnoozed when the timer runs out.

### Mark thread as `Todo`

This is useful if you mistakenly marked a thread as `Done` or snoozed a thread and want to unsnooze it. Otherwise just write a message or do what you want to do and the thread will be automatically moved back to do **Todo**.
