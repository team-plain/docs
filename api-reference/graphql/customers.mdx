Customers that reach out to you will automatically be created in Plain without requiring any API integration.

However, using our API to manage customers proactively can be helpful when you are optimizing your support workflow.

For example:

- You can [**put customers into groups**](/api-reference/graphql/customers/customer-groups/) to better organize your support queue. For example, you could group customers by pricing tier (e.g. Free Tier, Teams, Enterprise)
- You can [**create customers**](/api-reference/graphql/customers/upsert/) in Plain when they sign-up on your own site so that you can reach out to them proactively without waiting for them to get in touch.
- You can [**save your own customer's ID**](/api-reference/graphql/customers/upsert) for use with [**customer cards**](/customer-cards/).
