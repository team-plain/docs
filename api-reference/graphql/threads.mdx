Threads are the core of Plain's data model and equivalent to tickets or conversations in other support platforms. When you use Plain to help a customer you assign yourself to a thread and then mark the thread as `Done` once you're done helping.

Threads are automatically created when a new email is received but can also be created via the API (when a customer submits a contact form for example).

Threads have a status which can be in either `Todo`, `Snoozed` or `Done` and can only be assigned to one person.

Threads belong to one customer but can contain multiple email threads and customers.

An example thread looks like this:

  The below is only showing a subset fields a thread has. Since our API is a GraphQL API you decide
  which fields you need when you make API requests. Use our [API
  explorer](https://app.plain.com/developer/api-explorer) to discover the full schema of threads.
