Labels are a light-weight but powerful way to categorise threads, consisting of label text coupled with an icon. Each thread can have multiple labels.

They can be added manually or programmatically. For example when a contact form is submitted, you could automatically add a label to the corresponding thread with the issue category they selected, so that you know upfront why they are getting in touch.

The available labels you can apply are defined by your label types. Label types can be created and managed in your settings (**âŒ˜ + K** and then search for "Manage labels").

When you want to stop a label being available you can archive a label type. Archived label types are kept on existing threads in order to avoid losing valuable historic data.

Label changes can also be a starting point for integrations [via our webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/thread-labels-changed). This lets you build workflows triggered by the addition of a label.
