title: 'Request signing'
---

We sign outbound requests we make to your target URLs with a HMAC signature using a shared secret key. This allows you to verify that the request was made by Plain and not a third party. 

## How to verify

Your workspace has a global HMAC secret, this secret can be viewed and (re)generated by workspace admins in **Settings** → **Request signing**. 

If you have a HMAC secret set up, when you receive a request from Plain you will see a header `Plain-Request-Signature` with the HMAC signature.
You can verify this signature by hashing the request body with your HMAC secret and comparing it to the signature in the header.

**The signature is a SHA-256 hash of the request body, encoded as a hexadecimal string.**

### Node example

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// You may need to stringify the request body if you are using a library that parses it to a javascript object
const requestBody = JSON.stringify(request.body);

const incomingSignature = request.headers['Plain-Request-Signature'];
const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha-256', '<HMAC SECRET>').update(requestBody).digest('hex');

if (incomingSignature !== expectedSignature) {
  return response.status(403).send('Forbidden');
}
```
