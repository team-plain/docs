To be able to keep track of additional information related to a support request, you can configure additional custom fields you want to store on a thread.

To configure the schema for thread fields go to **Settings** â†’ **Thread fields**

Thread fields can either be:

- A boolean (true or false)
- Text
- A dropdown (single select from a predetermined list)

Thread fields can also be nested and be conditional on answers from other fields.

Fields can also be marked as required. This is useful when there is some information you want to collect on every support request before it is marked as done.

Thread fields can also be **auto-filled via AI**. To enable this behaviour in the settings for any thread field enable "Autofill via AI". The description you provide for each field will be used to guide suggestions.
