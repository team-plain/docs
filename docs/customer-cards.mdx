Customer Cards are:

- Pulled from your backend so you do not have to sync your customer data to Plain.
- Short-lived so that no data is permanently stored in Plain beyond the time frame you set.
- Defined using a simple JSON schema, so you don't have to worry about styling them.
- Automatically reloaded if a user is viewing a customer and the data expires.
