title: 'Create a thread event'
---

<Info>
  A thread event will only be created in the thread ID provided. If you want an event to appear in
  all threads for a customer please use a [customer event](/graphql/events/create-customer-event).
</Info>

To create a thread event you need a thread ID.

You can get this by [creating a thread](/graphql/threads/create) in Plain, from data in webhooks or other API calls you made. If you want to test this, press **⌘ + K** on any thread and then "Copy thread ID" to get an ID you can experiment with.

In this example we'll be creating the following event:

    For this you'll need an API key with the following permissions:
    - `threadEvent:create`
    - `threadEvent:read`
    - `thread:read`
    - `customer:read`

    <Snippet file="typescript-sdk/create-thread-event.mdx" />
    Which would console.log:
    <Snippet file="typescript-sdk/create-thread-event-response.mdx" />
