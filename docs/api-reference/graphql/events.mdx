Events are created via the Plain API and you have full control of what they look like using Plain's UI components.

When you create an event for a customer it will show in all of their threads past and present. If you are building a more advanced API integration you can also create an event specific to a thread by providing a thread id when creating it.

Events are stored permanently in Plain.

## UI Components

To define what each event should look like, you use the Plain UI components. All the components are documented in the [Plain UI Components](/ui-components/) section.

## Playground

<Warning>
  **Coming soon!**

  We're still working on a nice interactive playground but in the meantime you may want to use the [Customer Cards Playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/customer-cards-playground/) as they both use the same [UI components](/ui-components/) so you can get a good visual sense of what your event will look like.
