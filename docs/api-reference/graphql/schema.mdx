description: We build the Plain app using this API so there are no limits in terms of what you can do programmatically vs. using the Plain app."

If you need the schema programmatically for code generation or if you just want to read the schema you can view the [raw GraphQL schema](https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1/schema.graphql).

You can also use the [API Explorer](https://app.plain.com/developer/api-explorer/) to learn about our API schema. This is the easiest way of discovering everything possible with the GraphQL API.
