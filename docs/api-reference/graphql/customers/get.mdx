title: 'Fetch customers'
---

We provide a number of methods for fetching customers:

1. [Get customers](#get-customers)
1. [Get customer by ID](#get-customer-by-id)
1. [Get customer by email](#get-customer-by-email)

All of these endpoints require the following permissions:

- `customer:read`

## Get customers

Our API allows you to fetch customers as a collection using `getCustomers` in our SDKs or the `customers` query in GraphQL. In both cases this endpoint supports [Pagination](/graphql/pagination).

This is a very flexible endpoint which supports a variety of options for filtering and sorting, for full details try our [API explorer](https://app.plain.com/developer/api-explorer/) or [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/team-plain/typescript-sdk/).

## Get customer by ID

If you already have the ID of a customer from within Plain or one of our other endpoints you can fetch more details about them using `getCustomerById` in our SDKs or the `customer` query in GraphQL.
