Now, the nerdy bit - this is a breakdown of the exact metrics we show in Reporting and how they're calculated.

<Note>
All metrics can also be broken down by Channel, Company, Group, Label, Priority and Tier.

## Support Volume

| Metric                        | Definition                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue size                    | A snapshot of the number of threads in Todo over time, updating hourly.      |
| New threads created per day   | A count of new threads being created.                                        |
| Threads re-opened per day     | A count of threads that transition back to Todo from either Snoozed or Done. |
| Threads moved to Done per day | A count of threads transitioned to Done.                                     |
| Messages sent per user        | A count of messages sent by each user.                                       |

## Response Time and Resolution Metrics

For all the metrics below, we use two statistical measures:
- **Median:** The middle value where half of cases are faster and half are slower. Use this to understand your team's typical performance. For example, if your median first response time is 4 hours, that's what customers typically experience.
- **90th percentile:** The threshold where 90% of cases are faster and 10% are slower. Use this to spot problem areas that need attention. For example, if your 90th percentile resolution time is 5 days while your median is 1 day, you might want to investigate what's causing some tickets to take so much longer and review how you handle complex cases.

### First Response Time
The time it takes for your team to send the first reply to a new thread.

### Resolution Time
The time between the first inbound message and when the thread was **effectively** done. This can happen in two ways, manually or automatically:
- If you manually mark a thread as Done, the resolution time is measured from the first inbound message until that moment.
- If the thread is automatically marked as Done after being set to 'Waiting for Customer', the resolution time is measured from the first inbound message until the 'Waiting for Customer' status was set.

<Note>
Remember that you can control when a thread is automatically marked as Done under **Settings** -> **Workflow**.

### Customer Waiting Time
The total time a thread spends in Todo status, representing how long customers wait for attention.
