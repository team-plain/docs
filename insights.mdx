**Insights** give you an overview of your support workload allowing you to analyze trends, identify improvement areas and answer questions like:

- Are we prioritizing support requests correctly?
- What product areas are creating most of our support volume?
- Are we meeting all of our SLAs?
- What companies are we speaking with most?
- Are we becoming more efficient?
- And lots more

## Using Insights

You can access Insights from the left sidebar of the Plain app or by hovering over a Label, Tier, Group or Company tag.

Insights give you the following metrics and much more:

1. **Support volume**: The number amount of threads in your queue at any given point in time.
2. **First response time**: How quickly your customers receive a first reply from you.
3. **Next response time**: How quickly your customers receive a subsequent reply from you.
4. **Resolution time**: How long it takes you to resolve support requests.

### Get a birds-eye view

At the top of the Insights page you will see the overall health of your support. How is your queue looking? Are you keeping up with your response time targets? Are you resolving your customers requests quickly?

### Get into the details

In each section of Insights, you will see a breakdown of your support by Channel, Company, Group, Label, Priority and Tier. This lets you see which attributes of a support request might be contributing to slower response times or increased volume.
