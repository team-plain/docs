Plain supports Discord, Slack and Email notifications. Notifications are also divided into **Workspace Notifications** and **Personal Notifications**.

### Workspace notifications

Workspace notifications are global to your workspace via Slack and/or Discord. They are typically used to notify you as a team of a new support request or other activity.

We recommend setting up a shared channel like #support and then having all workspace notifications go there.

You can configure workspace notifications in **Settings** â†’ **Workspace**.

### Personal notifications

Personal notifications are via Slack or Email. We recommend setting up notifications here to be notified of threads you are assigned to.

You can manage your personal notifications in Preferences.
Click your avatar at the bottom right of the sidebar, then select Preferences. From there, use the sidebar to access your Slack and email notification settings.

When you use personal Slack notifications they will be delivered in the Plain Slack App direct message channel with you.
