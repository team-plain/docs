title: 'How Slack messages create threads in Plain'
---

Everyone sends messages in Slack differently. Here’s a high-level breakdown of how Slack messages create threads in Plain:

1. **Multiple messages in main channel -** multiple messages sent subsequently in the main channel will be treated as one thread in Plain.

2. **Messages in a Slack thread-** All messages on a Slack thread will be mapped to the thread in Plain created by the message in the main channel.

3. **Multiple messages in the main channel, separated by a thread -** Once a Slack thread is created, the next message in the main channel will create a _new_ thread in Plain.
