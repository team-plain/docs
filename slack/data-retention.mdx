When you add Plain to a Slack channel, Plain stores information from that Slack channel. This is to enable you to provide support on Slack through Plain.

Plain only stores information from Slack channels you add the Plain bot to, so you are in control of what gets added to Plain.

When the Plain app is added to a channel, Plain will begin to store the following Slack data:

- Message contents
- Message metadata (e.g. timestamps, ids, reactions etc.)
- Channel members (used for @ mentioning and showing the author of messages)
- Channel metadata (e.g. name, id, connected team ids etc.)

Any additional data that Plain receives from Slack's APIs but that is not required for the operation of the service is automatically deleted after a 7 day period. The 7 day period allows us to recover messages in the case of an incident.

When a message is deleted within Slack, Plain will delete the corresponding message content in Plain. Plain will keep a record that there was a message and who wrote it, but not its contents. This ensures that there remains an audit trail for every support request, even if a message is deleted.
