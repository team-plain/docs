title: 'How to rename your Slack bot'
---

By default, when the Plain bot is added to a channel, it will have the name `Plain`, but you can adjust this via your slack workspace settings.

To do that, open [The slack bot page](https://plaintestworkspace.slack.com/marketplace/A03RQJJFZUP-plain) and then:
 * Choose your slack workspace at the top-right
 * Go to Configuration > Bot User and click "Edit"
