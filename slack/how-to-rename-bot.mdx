title: "How to customize your Slack bot"
---

By default, when the Plain bot is added to a channel, it will have the name `Plain` and use the Plain logo, but you can adjust this via your workspace settings. In your workspace settings, hit "General". From here you can:

- Add the logo that will appear:
  - in the chat widget (if you don't set one for the chat app)
  - inside the Plain web app
  - on unread chat messages emails (if you don't have a chat app logo)
  - on the autoresponder messages in Slack
- Customize your public name that will be shown to customers (usually your company name)

You can also update the name of your Slack bot by configuring it on the [slack bot page](https://plaintestworkspace.slack.com/marketplace/A03RQJJFZUP-plain) (go to Configuration \> Bot User and click "Edit), but note that the name in your workspace settings will take precedence.Â
