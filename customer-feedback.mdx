title: 'Customer Feedback'
---
Automatically collect feedback at the end of each support thread — so you can spot issues early, improve team performance, and show customers you’re listening.

<Info>
  Customer feedback is only available on our [Grow and Scale tiers](https://plain.com/pricing). If you are interested in using this feature please reach out to use on [sales@plain.com](mailto:plain@sales.com).

### What you can do with CSAT
- Capture sentiment from customers with a one-click survey sent after a thread is marked as done.
- See feedback at a glance — who responded, what they said, and which thread it relates to.
- Create multiple feedback forms to segment your surveys (e.g. Enterprise vs everyone else).
- Track and improve with CSAT reporting that breaks down ratings and comments.


### Where it works
CSAT surveys work across all channels — Slack, Discord, Email, Chat, Microsoft Teams, Portal, and API.

We’ll send the survey natively in Slack, and as an email for all other channels. Wherever the conversation happens, you can follow up with a feedback request.


### How it works
Once a thread is marked as Done, Plain sends a short survey asking the customer how the support experience went — they can rate it positive, neutral, or negative, and leave an optional comment.

All responses are stored and visible:
	- In the thread sidebar, so your team can see feedback in context.
	- In Reporting > CSAT, so you can view response trends over time or view individual feedback.


### Customising surveys
<Frame>![CSAT in Plain](/public/images/customise-feedback-form.png)</Frame>

You can create and manage multiple CSAT surveys to target different parts of your customer base.

You can:
- Customize the survey message.
- Set a delay before sending (e.g. 15 minutes after a thread is marked Done).
- Control frequency so customers aren’t asked to rate every thread.

### To get started
	1.	Go to Settings → Customer survey
	2.	Click "New customer survey
	3.	Set your rules, and you’re done

### Best practices
- **Start small**. Set up one general-purpose survey before adding segmentation.
- **Review feedback regularly**. Use the CSAT report to spot trends and act on negative feedback.
- **Be respectful**. Use the "Time between surveys" feature to avoid over-surveying your customers.
