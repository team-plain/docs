Within Plain you can organise companies and tenants to match your pricing tiers (e.g. Enterprise, Pro, Free etc.).

To manage your tiers go to **Settings** â†’ **Tiers**.

Tiers can be managed manually or [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/tiers/).


### Tiers and priorities

Tiers can have a default priority. This allows you to, for example, say that every Enterprise support request should have a priority of "High" as well as have a first response time SLA of 30 minutes.

### SLAs

When configuring an SLA you can set when you want to be warned of a breach. For example if your first response time SLA is 4 hours, you might want to be notified 30 minutes before a breach so you can still reply in time.

SLAs can also be driven by priority of threads. This allows you to have a different SLAs for "Urgent" vs "Normal" priority threads. If you have configure multiple SLAs for the same priority then only the first SLA will apply.

If you want to create a 'default' SLA then you can need to first create a tier and make that the default in your settings. Then you can configure SLAs like you would on any other tier.
