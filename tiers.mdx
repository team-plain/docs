Within Plain you can organise companies and tenants to match your pricing tiers (e.g. Enterprise, Pro, Free etc.).

To manage your tiers go to **Settings** → **Tiers**.

Tiers can have associated SLA as well as default priority. This allows you to, for example, say that every Enterprise support request should have a priority of "High" as well as have a first response time SLA of 30 minutes.

Tiers can be managed manually or via the API.

When configuring an SLA you can set when you want to be warned of a breach. For example if your first response time SLA is 4 hours, you might want to be notified 30 minutes before then in order to reply in time.
