<Frame>![Tiers and SLAs within Plain](/public/images/tiers-introduction.png)</Frame>

Within Plain you can organise companies and tenants to match your pricing tiers (e.g. Enterprise, Pro, Free etc.).

To manage your tiers go to **Settings** → **Tiers**.

Tiers can be managed manually or [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/tiers/).

### Priorities

Tiers can have a default priority. This allows you to, for example, set all Enterprise support requests to have a priority of "High". This means you can encourage prioritisation by tier (e.g. "Enterprise first, then Pro, then everyone else").

### SLAs

When configuring an SLA you can set when you want to be warned of a breach. For example if your first response time SLA is 4 hours, you might want to be notified 30 minutes before a breach so you can still reply in time.

SLAs can also be driven by priority of threads. This allows you to have a different SLAs for "Urgent" vs "Normal" priority threads. If you have configure multiple SLAs for the same priority then only the first SLA will apply.

If you want to create a 'default' SLA then you can need to first create a tier and make that the default in your settings. Then you can configure SLAs like you would on any other tier.

### Business hours

By default SLAs apply at all times. They can be configured to only count working hours by toggling on **Only during business hours**.

To configure business hours go to **Settings** → **Business hours**
