This lets you easily link a Linear issue to a thread.

To do this, head to **Settings** → **Linear integration** and connect your workspace.

Once this set-up is done, you can add a Linear issue from the right hand side of a thread or by pressing the shortcut `i`.

Once a Linear issue is linked, the thread will move back to Todo when the Linear issue is completed or cancelled.

This means that you can update customers when a bug or feature request that they reported has been fixed.
