When you create an event in Plain, you can specify the content of the event using a simple GraphQL request and our [UI Components](/ui-components).

When a customer gets in touch, you will see the events you created on the thread's timeline, along with all other messages and activity.

Some examples use-cases of events:

- Keep track of key account activity such as upgrading of plans, inviting team members or changing sensitive settings in your product.
- Logging errors or potential issues your customers run into (e.g. someone encounters an unexpected error using your product)
- Logging key events in your own system such as the changing of feature flags or releases.
