# Delete customers

You can delete customers with the `deleteCustomer` API, you will find this name in both our API and our SDKs.

To delete a customer you will need the customer's ID from within Plain. You can get this ID in the UI by going to a thread from that customer and pressing the 'Copy ID' button from the customer details panel on the right, or via our [fetch API](/graphql/customers/get).

Deleting a customer will trigger an asynchronous process which causes all data (such as threads) associated with that customer to be deleted.

This operation requires the following permissions:

- `customer:delete`
