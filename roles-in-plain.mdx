Below you'll find the roles available within your Plain workspace. Set your team's roles depending on the level of access and ownership they need.

- `Owner`: Full access to everything, including billing, deleting workspaces, managing workspace settings and API keys.
- `Admin`: Access to everything in Plain except for billing and deleting workspaces.
- `Support`: Can message customers and use all in-app features.
- `Viewer`: Can view all support requests and participate in internal discussions, but cannot send messages to customers via Plain. Viewer seats are completely free, and unlimited.

**Note**: Owner, Admin, and Support seats are paid seats in Plain, while viewer seats are free. [View our full pricing breakdown here](https://www.plain.com/pricing)

You can view and update existing user's roles or add new users from **Settings** → **Members**.

You can also manage billing directly from Plain. Navigate to **Settings** → **Billing** to view, or make changes to your billing settings.
