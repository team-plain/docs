Our saved views allows your team to create and save different views of your support queue at a workspace level (saved views are not currently available at an individual level). 

With saved views, your team can customize and save different views based on: 

### Filters: 
- Assignee 
- Label 
- Status
- Company
- Tenant
- Tier 
- Priority 
- Group 
- Channel 
- Thread field 

### Sorting by: 
- Status changed at, oldest first 
- Status changed at, newest first 
- Closest to breaching SLA
- Priority high to low
- Most recent message

### Grouping:
- None
- Priority
- Status
- Company
- Label
- Tier
- Channel
- Assignee
- Group

You can also save a view in either board or table format, and change the information you want to see in your cards or rows – like labels, issues, priority, and more. 

To create a new saved view for your workspace, navigate to “Views” in your left sidebar. Once you select “Create view” you’ll be able to choose the properties you want to include.
