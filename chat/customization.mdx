## Enhance your chat flows with Plain’s data model

Plain’s chat widget is designed to be flexible and powerful. You can use Plain’s data model to enhance your chat flows, providing a more tailored experience for your users and 
improving your ability to triage and respond.

You can currently set the following fields on threads created from the chat widget:
* Labels
* Tiers
* Tenants
* External IDs

There are several places in the configuration you can add these with varying effects:

### All threads

Providing a top-level `threadDetails` object in the `Plain.init` function will set these fields on all threads created from the chat widget. You could, for example,
set a label based on the page the user is on.

### Chat buttons

Aside from being able to customize the text and icon of the chat button, you can also provide a set of fields that will be set on the thread when the user clicks that specific button. 

You can add these by providing a `threadDetails` object to an item within `chatButtons` array. For example, you could add a button for users to report a bug, which would set a label on the thread to `Bug report`.

### Chat forms

Similar to chat buttons, chat forms allow you to set fields on the thread when the user creates a chat. These are specific to each `chatButton`.
