## Enhance your chat flows with Plain’s data model

Plain’s chat widget is designed to be flexible and powerful. You can use Plain’s data model to enhance your chat flows, providing a more tailored experience for your users and 
improving your ability to triage and respond.

You can currently set the following fields on threads created from the chat widget:
* Labels
* Tiers
* Tenants
* External IDs

There are several places in the configuration you can add these with varying effects:

### All threads

Providing a top-level `threadDetails` object in the `Plain.init` function will set these fields on all threads created from the chat widget. You could, for example,
set a label based on the page the user is on.

### Chat buttons

You can configure the primary chat button and any additional chat buttons that appear on the intro screen with text and an icon using the `chatButtons` array.

You can also pass `threadDetails` to a chat button to set fields on the thread when the user creates a chat from that specific button. If you provide the same field
in both the top-level `threadDetails` and a chat button, any single value fields will be overridden by the chat button and any multi-value fields will be appended to.

### Chat forms

Similar to chat buttons, chat forms allow you to set fields on the thread when the user creates a chat. These are specific to each `chatButton`.
