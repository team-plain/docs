## Providing customer details

By default, customers chatting with you will be anonymous. You can pass customer details, if you know them, in the `Plain.init` function call:

```typescript
Plain.init({
  // ... Other options
  customerDetails: {
    fullName: 'John Doe', // Optional
    shortName: 'John', // Optional
    chatAvatarUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/32/32', // Optional
  }
});
```

These details will be shown to you in the Plain app when you are chatting with the customer but they will not be matched to an existing customer even if they have the same details.

## Matching chat users to existing customers

If you want to match the customer to an existing customer in your workspace, you will need to pass their email. To avoid security issues around impersonation you will also need to
provide the email address hashed using a shared secret. You can generate this secret in the Chat settings page in the Plain app.

Once you have this secret, you can calculate the hash and pass it to the `Plain.init` function:

```typescript
import * as crypto from 'node:crypto';

const secret = '<YOUR_SECRET>';
const email = 'johndoe@example.com';
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
hmac.update(email);
const hash = hmac.digest('hex');

Plain.init({
  customerDetails: {
    email: email,
    emailHash: hash,
    // If you pass other customer details (e.g. fullName), this will also update their customer details within Plain
    // If you don't pass any other customer details, we will use their existing details within Plain
  }
});
```
