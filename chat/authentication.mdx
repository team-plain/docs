## Authentication options

By default, customers chatting with you will be anonymous. You can pass customer details, if you know them, in the `Plain.init` function call:

```typescript
Plain.init({
  // ... Other options
  customerDetails: {
    fullName: 'John Doe', // Optional
    shortName: 'John', // Optional
    chatAvatarUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/32/32', // Optional
  },
});
```

If you want to provide an email address for the customer, you can do so by passing an `email` property in the `customerDetails` object. We will only accept email addresses **that have been verified**.

In order to know that the email address that you provide has been verified, we require an `emailHash`, which is a hash of the email address and a secret.

This `emailHash` can be either manually provided by you or you can use our built-in email verification process to do it for you. Both methods are described below.

### Manual email verification - when you already know the user's identity

<Note>
Use this when you have already authenticated the user in your application and you know their **verified** email address.
</Note>

If your chat widget is embedded within an authenticated application (e.g. behind a login), you already know the user's identity. In this case, you can directly match the authenticated user to their Plain customer record:

1. Generate a secret in the Chat settings page on Plain
2. Calculate the email hash **in your backend**:

```typescript
import * as crypto from 'node:crypto';

const secret = '<YOUR_SECRET>';
const email = 'johndoe@example.com';
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
hmac.update(email);
const hash = hmac.digest('hex');
```

3. Finally, pass both the email and email hash when initializing the Plain widget:

```typescript
const email = 'johndoe@example.com';
const emailHash = await fetchHashFromBackend(email);

Plain.init({
  customerDetails: {
    email,
    emailHash,
    // Optional: additional customer details
    fullName: 'John Doe',
    shortName: 'John',
    chatAvatarUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/32/32',
  },
});
```

<Warning>
Always calculate the email hash **in your server** to avoid exposing your secret.
</Warning>

### Built-in email verification - when you don't know the user's identity

<Note>
Use this when you don't know who the user is and you want to make sure that all users writing through the widget have a verified email address. You can also use this within an authenticated application, if you don't want to provide the email hash yourself.
</Note>

If your chat widget is publicly accessible (e.g., on your marketing website), you should use Plain's built-in customer verification system. This ensures that customers can prove their identity through email verification.

To enable this, set the `requireAuthentication` option to `true` when initializing the Plain widget:

```typescript
Plain.init({
  requireAuthentication: true
});
```

When enabled:
1. New customers will need to provide their email address
2. They'll receive a verification code via email
3. After verification, they can start chatting
