title: 'Update company tier'
---

If you want to explicitly set the tier for a company you can do so using this mutation. If instead you want to add many companies to a tier at once, you can use the [add members mutation](./add-members).

For this mutation you need the following permissions:

- `tierMembership:read`
- `tierMembership:create`
