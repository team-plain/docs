Within Plain you can organise [companies](https://plain.support.site/article/companies) and [tenants](https://plain.support.site/article/tenants) into Tiers. Tiers should match your pricing tiers (e.g. "Enterprise", "Pro", "Free", etc.).

This allows you to prioritise and filter your support requests by tier.

Tiers also add support for defining [SLAs](https://plain.support.site/article/tiers) so you can enforce a first-response time for different support tiers within your product or pricing.

Typically, tiers are created via the UI in Plain and then tenants and companies are added and removed via the API when this happens in your product so Plain is in sync.
