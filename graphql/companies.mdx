Within Plain every customer can belong to one company. The company is infered automatically using the customer's email address. For example if their email address ends with "@nike.com" then their company will be automatically set to "Nike".

Companies allow you to prioritise and filter your support requests.

Additionally [tiers and SLAs](https://plain.support.site/article/tiers) can be associated with a company.
