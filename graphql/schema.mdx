If you need the schema programmatically for code generation or if you just want to read the schema you can view the [raw GraphQL schema](https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1/schema.graphql).

You can also use the [API Explorer](https://app.plain.com/developer/api-explorer/) to learn about our API schema. This is the easiest way of discovering everything possible with the GraphQL API.
