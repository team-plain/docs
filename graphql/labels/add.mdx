title: 'Add labels'
---

You can add multiple labels to a thread with a call to `addLabels`. Label type IDs passed to this endpoint should not be archived, we return a validation error with code `cannot_add_label_using_archived_label_type` for any which are submitted.

If a label type you provide is already added to the thread we will return a validation error with code `label_with_given_type_already_added_to_thread`.

You can retrieve label type IDs in the Plain UI settings by hovering over a label type and selecting 'Copy label ID' from the overflow menu.

This operation requires the following permissions:

- `label:create`
