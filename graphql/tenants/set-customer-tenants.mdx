title: 'Set customer tenants'
---

You can also set all tenants for a customer. Unlike the more specific add or remove mutations this is useful if you are sycing tenants and customers with Plain.

For this mutation you need the following permissions:

- `customer:edit`
- `customerTenantMembership:create`
- `customerTenantMembership:delete`
