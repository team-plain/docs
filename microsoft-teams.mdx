<Note>
  Microsoft Teams support is something we recently shipped. As you'd be among our early adopters, we'd love for you to [book a demo with us](https://38j36lhg2hq.typeform.com/to/zRvsFJPO?typeform-source=www.plain.com) so we can show you around.
</Note>

Our Microsoft Teams integration lets you sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

To get started you need to:

- Create a team and a channel in Microsoft Teams
- Install the Plain app in Microsoft Teams
- Invite guests

Once this is set up, the integration allows you to:

- Respond to teams messages in Plain
- Sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain
- Reply as your Teams user from Plain

Here's a quick demo of the Plain Microsoft Teams integration in action, to get started, see the [installation guide](./microsoft-teams/installation).
