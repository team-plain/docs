Smart AI Responses allows you to generate responses to support requests based on your documentation and the contents of a thread.

Responses are not automatically sent, the composer will be populated with the suggested response, which you can either send as is, or edit as you wish.

### Indexing documentation for use with Smart AI Responses

Documentation can be indexed by using the [Plain CLI](https://github.com/team-plain/cli). With it you can index:
- a single URL
- a sitemap URL (each entry in the sitemap is indexed)

For installation and usage instructions, please see the [Plain CLI docs](https://github.com/team-plain/cli).

### Automation

To keep indexed documents upto date, you can automate the indexing process the Plain CLI on a schedule.

#### Github Actions example

Here is an example Github Action to re-index the documents using the [Plain CLI](https://github.com/team-plain/cli) run on a schedule.
- The action runs every 3 hours
- The action uses the `PLAIN_API_KEY` secret to authenticate with the Plain API
- The action indexes all URLs in the sitemap

```yaml
name: Index docs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */3 * * *"

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Index Documents
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install CLI
        run: npm install -g @team-plain/cli@latest

      - name: Index Documents
        run: plain index-sitemap https://www.plain.com/docs/sitemap.xml
        env:
          PLAIN_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PLAIN_API_KEY }}`
```
