Snippets are templated messages in Plain that you can quickly combine to help customers more quickly.

You can configure your snippets in **Settings** â†’ **Snippets**.

You can then press **[** to insert a snippet when writing in a thread.

Snippets can either be entire messages or short re-usable bits.

For example:

- Common links such as to your docs, status page, calendar booking links etc.
- Re-usable apologies and greetings such as "So sorry to hear about, let me look into that." or "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- Common instructions and how-to's to your product

Within snippets you can also use some variables to include dynamic data. The following variables can be used:

- `{{ customer.email }}`: The customer's email address.
- `{{ customer.fullName }}`: The first and last name of the customer.
- `{{ customer.shortName }}`: If set, the short/first name of the customer.
- `{{ user.publicName }}`: Your public name (useful for signatures).
- `{{ user.fullName }}`: Your full name
