When viewing your threads queue you can at a glance see key metrics on your current support queue.

You can see:

- The breakdown of why a thread is in `Todo` (whether it's new threads, replies, Linear issues, etc.)
- Distribution of threads by priority
- A preview of how many threads will be unsnoozed in the next 24 hours
- Counts of assigned vs. unassigned threads
- Breakdown of threads by customer group
- Count of threads by label
