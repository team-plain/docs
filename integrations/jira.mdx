title: 'Jira integration'

To easily keep track of feature requests and bugs reported by your customers in Plain, you can connect your Jira workspace to Plain.

This lets you easily link a Jira issue to a thread, and ensures you're always prompted to reply to a customer when their bug is fixed or feature request is shipped. 

To do this, head to Settings → Jira integration and connect your workspace.

Once you've linked your Jira workspace to Plain, you can create a Jira issue (or link an existing Jira issue) directly to a customer request in the sidebar on the right hand side of a thread – or by pressing the shortcut: `i`. 

Once a Jira issue is linked, the thread will move back to Close the loop when the Jira issue is completed, canceled or deleted.

**Coming soon:** you'll be able to get a ranked view of your top customer requests from Jira directly in Plain. You'll also be able to dig into each request, to understand which customers requested each feature, the tier breakdown of these customers and when the request was initially made. Please reach out to us if you'd like a demo of this feature.
