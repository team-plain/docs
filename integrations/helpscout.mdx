title: 'Helpscout importer'
---

To connect your HelpScout account, head to **Settings** → **HelpScout importer** and follow the instructions.
You can also sync multiple HelpScout mailboxes to Plain if you need to.

When you connect your HelpScout account with Plain, we will import:

- all your end users as Plain [**customers**](/api-reference/graphql/customers)
- all your conversations as Plain [**threads**](/api-reference/graphql/threads). We will import all conversation threads as messages, and all internal notes. We'll map every HelpScout conversation status to an equivalent Plain thread status.
- all the conversation tags as Plain [**labels**](/api-reference/graphql/labels)
- all attachments that were previously added to conversations in HelpScout, will be added to threads in Plain

After you connect HelpScout for the first time, we will import all your existing data.
From that point, any new new end user, conversation, thread, note, or tag created in your
HelpScout account, will be automatically synced into Plain and kept up-to-date.

To stop syncing data from HelpScout, click on **Settings** → **HelpScout importer** -> **Disconnect**.

<Info>
  The data created through the HelpScout importer will not trigger any webhooks or auto-responders.

The HelpScout importer is available on [Scale tier](https://www.plain.com/pricing) only – please [reach out for a demo](https://38j36lhg2hq.typeform.com/to/zRvsFJPO) if your interested.

<Note>
  We will only create new records in Plain, we will never update existing ones: - once an end user
  is synced into Plain, further changes to that end user in HelpScout (e.g. changing their name)
  will not be synced into Plain. - if a customer or label is modified on Plain after syncing them
  from HelpScout, further syncs from HelpScout will not override your changes on Plain. - the same
  applies to threads and notes.
