Our Intercom importer makes it easy to migrate your historical conversations, customers, and admins from Intercom into Plain.

### What we import

When you run an Intercom import, we import:

- **Contacts → Customers**: All Intercom contacts are imported as customers in Plain.
- **Conversations → Threads**: All conversation types – chat, email, and more – are imported as threads.

Each imported thread will show “Intercom” as the channel in Plain. We also include a link back to the original conversation in Intercom for easy reference.

If a customer already exists in Plain, we’ll automatically associate any imported threads with that customer.

### Getting started

To run an import, head to **Settings → Integrations → Intercom** and follow the prompts to connect your Intercom account.

The import can take some time depending on the size of your workspace. Once it’s complete, you’ll see all imported conversations appear in Plain, fully attributed and linked. After the initial migration has taken place, any new contacts, admins, or conversations will automatically be synced to Plain every hour.
