We’ve partnered with Inkeep to make Keep, Inkeep’s copilot for support, available via API in your Plain workspace. 

Keep's Smart Assist mode analyzes the thread you're currently looking at to generate intelligent suggestions to move the conversation forward.

Suggestions can include:

1. Draft Answers: Editable responses that are likely to resolve the issue.

2. Quick Links: Relevant sources for the issue, such as docs, previous support requests, and Slack threads.

3. Summaries & To-Do's: Summaries of long conversations and actionable remaining to-dos.

4. Other: Quick replies, sentiment analysis, and other helpful insights.

Keep is fully conversational - you can ask for clarifications or even request modifications to suggested answers.

Check out [Inkeep’s docs](https://docs.inkeep.com/support-tools/agent-copilot/plain) for full setup instructions.
