To connect your Salesforce account, head to **Settings** → **Salesforce integration** and follow the instructions. It will take a couple of clicks.

When you connect your Salesforce account with Plain, we will:

- ## import all your contacts as Plain \*_customers_
- ## import the accounts linked to those contacts as Plain \*_tenants_

After you connect for the first time, we will import all your existing data. From that point, any new connection or account that you create in your Salesforce account, will be automatically synced into Plain.

To stop syncing data from Salesforce, click on _Disconnect_ in **Settings** → **Salesforce integration**.

<Note>
We will only **create** new records in Plain, we will **never update** existing ones:

- once a contact or account is synced into Plain, further changes to that contact in Salesforce (e.g. changing their name) will not be synced into Plain
- if a customer or tenant is modified **on Plain** after syncing them from Salesforce, further syncs from Salesforce will not override your changes on Plain
