title: "Rootly Integration"
---

The Rootly integration helps your support and engineering teams stay in sync when incidents happen. You can create or link Rootly incidents directly from a Plain thread, track their progress, and easily follow up with affected customers once things are resolved.

The Rootly integration is available on Grow \+ Scale tier. 

## **What you can do with the Rootly integration**

- **Create new Rootly incidents** from any support request in Plain.
- **Link existing Rootly incidents** to a thread to track status and coordinate updates.
- **Track resolution status**: when a linked incident is marked as resolved in Rootly, the thread in Plain automatically moves back to your TODO list – so you don’t forget to close the loop.
- **Assign key incident fields** like severity, team, and service – without ever leaving Plain.

## **When to use it**

This integration is especially useful for:

- **Turning support signals into incident triggers**. If a customer reaches out about a widespread issue, you can escalate it immediately – right from the support thread.
- **Connecting multiple customer conversations to a single incident**. When the incident is resolved, you’ll have a clear list of all the customers to update – no digging required.
- **Keeping your support team in the loop** on how incidents are progressing, without needing to switch tools.

## **How to set it up**

1. Go to settings → integrations → Rootly integration
2. Connect your Rootly account 
3. Once connected, you’ll be able to start incidents from support requests, link threads to ongoing incidents, and fill in optional fields like severity, team, and service. Just hit "Thread links" and link a Rootly incident. 

Once an incident is resolved in Rootly, all associated threads in Plain will return to your “Todo” list so you can follow up.
