title: 'Zendesk importer'
---

To connect your Zendesk account, head to **Settings** → **Zendesk importer** and follow the instructions. You will need your _Zendesk subdomain_, e.g. `plain` in `https://plain.zendesk.com/`

When you connect your Zendesk account with Plain, we will import:

- all your end users as Plain [**customers**](/api-reference/graphql/customers)
- all your tickets as Plain [**threads**](/api-reference/graphql/threads). We will import all messages in the tickets, including internal ones, which are imported as Plain **notes**. Tickets in status _closed_ or _solved_ will be imported as _DONE_ threads. All others will be imported as _TODO_ threads.
- all the ticket tags as Plain [**labels**](/api-reference/graphql/labels)

After you connect for the first time, we will import all your existing data. From that point, any new end user, ticket, message or tag created in your Zendesk account, will be automatically synced into Plain.

<Info>
  The data created through the Zendesk importer will not trigger any webhooks or auto-responders.
</Info>

To stop syncing data from Zendesk, click on _Disconnect_ in **Settings** → **Zendesk importer**.

<Note>
We will only **create** new records in Plain, we will **never update** existing ones:

- once an end user is synced into Plain, further changes to that end user in Zendesk (e.g. changing their name) will not be synced into Plain
- if a customer or label is modified **on Plain** after syncing them from Zendesk, further syncs from Zendesk will not override your changes on Plain

</Note>
