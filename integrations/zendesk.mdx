To connect your Zendesk account, head to **Settings** â†’ **Zendesk integration** and follow the instructions. You will need your 'Zendesk subdomain', e.g. `plain` in `https://plain.zendesk.com/`

When you connect your Zendesk account with Plain, we will:

- import all your end users as Plain **customers**
- import all your tickets as Plain **threads**. We will import all messages in the tickets, including internal ones, which are imported as Plain **notes**
- import all the ticket tags as Plain **labels**

After you connect for the first time, we will import all your existing data. From that point, any new end user, ticket, message or tag created in your Zendesk account, will be automatically synced into Plain.

<Note>
It is **important** to know that we will only **create** new records in Plain, we will **never update** existing ones:

- once a end user is synced into Plain, further changes to that end user in Zendesk (e.g. changing their name) will not be synced into Plain
- if a customer or label is modified **on Plain** after syncing them from Zendesk, further syncs from Zendesk will not override your changes on Plain
</Note>
