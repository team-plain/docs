To easily keep track of feature requests and bugs reported in Plain, you can connect your Linear workspace with Plain.

This lets you easily link a Linear issue to a thread – and ensures you're always reminded to reply to a customer when their bug is fixed or feature request is shipped. Threads are automatically moved to "Close the Loop" status when the associated Linear issue is complete.&#x20;

To do this, head to **Settings** → **Linear integration** and connect your workspace.

Once you've linked your Linear workspace to Plain, you can create a Linear issue (or link an existing Linear issue) directly to a thread in the sidebar on the right hand side of a thread – or by pressing the shortcut:`i`.

Once a Linear issue is linked, the thread will move back to `Close the loop` when the Linear issue is completed or canceled.

Once you connect your Linear account and start linking issues to customer requests, you'll get access to a new Product insights page in Plain – where you'll be able to get a ranked view of your top customer requests from Linear directly in Plain. You can also dig into each request, to understand which customers requested each feature, the tier breakdown of these customers and when the request was initially made.

### Linear Templates

If you've created templates for issues in Linear, you can choose which template you want to use every time you create a new issue from Plain. Get consistent with how you manage bugs, feature requests, or engineering tickets and ensure they're always presented the same way.&#x20;

When creating a Linear issue, just hit "No template" and choose the template you want to use.&#x20;

### Customer Requests

If your Linear workspace supports Customer Requests, we'll create a Customer and a Customer Request when linking a Plain thread to a Linear issue.

Linear Customers are created by looking at the Customer's company domain on the thread. If a Plain thread has no company domain, we won't create a Linear Customer or Customer Request.

If Linear Customer requests is disabled in your workspace, our linear integration will still create Customers and Customer Requests in the background, so if you decide to enable it, they'll be ready to go.
