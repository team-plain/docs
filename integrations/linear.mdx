To easily keep track of feature requests and bugs reported in Plain, you can connect your Linear workspace with Plain.

This lets you easily link a Linear issue to a thread – and ensures you're always prompted to reply to a customer when their bug is fixed or feature request is shipped.

To do this, head to **Settings** → **Linear integration** and connect your workspace.

Once you've linked your Linear workspace to Plain, you can create a Linear issue (or link an existing Linear issue) directly to a customer request in the sidebar on the right hand side of a thread – or by pressing the shortcut:`i`.

Once a Linear issue is linked, the thread will move back to `Close the loop` when the Linear issue is completed or canceled.

Once you connect your Linear account and start linking issues to customer requests, you'll get access to a new Product insights page in Plain – where you'll be able to get a ranked view of your top customer requests from Linear directly in Plain. You can also dig into each request, to understand which customers requested each feature, the tier breakdown of these customers and when the request was initially made.
