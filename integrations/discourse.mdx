title: 'Discourse Integration'
---

With Plain you can connect your Discourse community and automatically keep track of support requests via Plain.

This works by deploying a small node service which uses Plain and Discourse's APIs. You can either self-host this little node service or we can deploy this for you. 

**[Check out the example on Github →](https://github.com/team-plain/example-discourse-integration)**

This integration can be customised depending on the structure of your Discourse community and ideal support workflow. For example you could customise the priority, labels and assignee of support requests from Discourse based on their category, author and content. 

If you'd like help getting this set up, just reach out to us via Plain or on help@plain.com.
