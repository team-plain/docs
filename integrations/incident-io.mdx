The Incident.io integration ensures seamless collaboration between your support and engineering teams during incidents. Directly from a Plain thread, you can create or link incidents, and easily follow up with customers once issues are resolved.​

The Incident.io integration is available on Grow \+ Scale tiers. 

### What you can do with the Incident.io integration

- **Create new Incident.io incidents** from any support request in Plain.
- **Link existing Incident.io incidents** to a thread to track status and coordinate updates.
- **Track resolution status**: when a linked incident is marked as resolved in Incident.io, the thread in Plain automatically moves back to your TODO list – so you don’t forget to close the loop.
- **Assign key incident fields** like severity, team, and service – without ever leaving Plain.

### When to use it

This integration is useful for:

- **Turning support signals into incident triggers**. If a customer reaches out about a widespread issue, you can escalate it immediately – right from the support thread.
- **Connecting multiple customer conversations to a single incident**. When the incident is resolved, you’ll have a clear list of all the customers to update – no digging required.
- **Keeping your support team in the loop** on how incidents are progressing, without needing to switch tools.

### How to set it up 

Setting up the incident.io integration is really quick:

1. Go to settings → integrations → Incident.io integration
2. Connect your Incident.io account 
3. Once connected, you’ll be able to start incidents from support requests, link threads to ongoing incidents, and fill in optional fields like severity, team, and service. Just hit "Thread links" and link an Incident.io incident. 

Once an incident is resolved in Incident.io, all associated threads in Plain will return to your “Todo” list so you can follow up.
