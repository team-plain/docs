title: 'Shortcut integration'

To easily keep track of feature requests and bugs reported by your customers in Plain, you can connect your Shortcut workspace to Plain.

This lets you easily link a Shortcut story to a thread, and ensures you're always prompted to reply to a customer when their bug is fixed or feature request is shipped. 

To do this, head to Settings → Shortcut integration (under the Integrations section) and connect your workspace. Only one user needs access to the Shortcut workspace to connect it to Plain, after that all users of Plain can benefit from the integration.

Once you've linked your Shortcut workspace to Plain, you can create a Shortcut story (or link an existing Shortcut story) directly to a customer request in the sidebar on the right hand side of a thread – or by pressing the shortcut: `i`. 

Once a Shortcut story is linked, the thread will move back to Close the loop when the Shortcut story is completed, canceled or deleted.

Once you connect your Shortcut account and start linking stories to customer requests, you can access the Product insights page in Plain – where you get a ranked view of your top customer requests from Shortcut directly in Plain. You can also dig into each request, to understand which customers requested each feature, the tier breakdown of these customers and when the request was initially made.
