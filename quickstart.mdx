Plain is the support platform for B2B technical teams. Everything you need to help your customers in a modern, fast, and opinionated platform.

This quickstart will walk you through how to start helping customers and get the most out of Plain.

### The basics

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Create a workspace" icon="seedling">
Everything within Plain happens in a workspace. To create a workspace for your team, sign up at https://app.plain.com and click **Create a workspace**.

You will be guided through the set-up, including [configuring your email](/email). For this, you will need to be able to add a few DNS records for your domain.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Set up notifications" icon="bell">
To be notified of new support requests, [set up notifications](/notifications).

We recommend, as a minimum, setting up one shared Slack or Discord channel where new support requests are posted. We also recommend setting up personal notifications so you can be notified of new replies and activity on threads you are assigned to.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connect your Linear workspace" icon="link">
  [Connecting your Linear workspace](/linear) to Plain will let you quickly and seamlessly log bugs and feature requests to Linear without leaving Plain and then close the loop with the customer once they're completed.

You can connect to Linear from **Settings** â†’ **Linear**.

</Accordion>

### Adding context

To provide support more quickly, get more context into Plain from your own systems.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Add customer cards" icon="address-card">
Customer cards let you show live information from your own systems in Plain. This lets you bring important, business-specific context to Plain and makes it even easier to help customers without jumping through different tabs.

[**Set up customer cards**](/customer-cards/)

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Log key events" icon="code">
Events let you log important customer actions, errors, releases, and other key events to Plain. This gives you the full picture in the context of a support request as to what happened and why.

[**Set up events**](/events/)

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Set up customer groups" icon="user-group">
Setting up customer groups can let you organize and segment your customers and their threads. For example, you could organize your customers by their tier: "Free", "Growth", and "Enterprise" allowing you to quickly focus on all support requests from your Enterprise customers first.

[**Set up groups**](/customer-groups/)
