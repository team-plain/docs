### Getting started

1. Accessing the Discord integration: Go to your Plain workspace and navigate to **Settings** → **Channels** → **Discord**.

2. Click **Connect to Discord**. 

3. Choose the server you'd like to integrate with Plain 

4. Complete the Discord authorization process.

5. Once authorized, confirm that the Plain bot is now active and online in your Discord server.

Within the Discord integration page in Plain, you'll see the option to **"Connect your profile"**.
This enables team members to reply to Discord threads directly from Plain.

### How it works

* **Thread ingestion:** You can configure which channels to ingest first from the Discord settings page in Plain. All channels will be off by default, and you can toggle the ones on that you'd like to ingest support requests from. Threads from text channels or other areas (like private threads) will not be imported.

* **Responding to threads:** You can reply to Discord threads directly from Plain. Responses will appear in the associated Discord thread under the Plain bot, keeping the communication loop connected. You can always open the Discord thread from Plain to see extra context like labels. 

## **Features overview**

* **Unified communication:** Manage Discord customer threads alongside other support channels like email and live chat, all within Plain.

* **Effortless collaboration:** Team members can collaborate on Discord threads directly in Plain, ensuring efficient and consistent responses.

* **Customizable notifications:** Customize your notifications to stay on top of new or updated threads in Discord, so you never miss a message. 

## **Troubleshooting & FAQs**

**1. What if the Plain bot isn't showing up in my server?**
Ensure you've authorized the bot during setup and that it has the correct permissions. If the issue persists, reauthorize the integration and check Discord's role settings. Reach out if you have any issues! 

**2. Can we customize which Discord channels are imported into Plain?**
Yes – just head to your Discord settings page in Plain and toggle on the channels you'd like to ingest. 

**3. Is private thread support available?**
Not yet, but we're exploring this as a feature enhancement based on user demand.

**4. What permissions does the Plain bot need?**
The bot requires permission to:

* Read messages

* Post messages in threads

* Manage messages in the server

* Get channels of your guild

**Known limitations**

Some features like private thread ingestion and advanced filtering will be added soon.

* Support for showing and sending mentions and reactions in Plain.

* Rounding out "Discord" in the rest of the product - workflow rules, reporting, auto-responders.

* Showing avatars from Discord as the customer avatar in Plain.

* Verifying and connecting customers from Discord to existing customers in Plain through their emails.
