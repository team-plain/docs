**Never miss another message from a customer in Slack**

Our Slack integration lets you sync messages from selected Slack channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

You will also be able to [add context to Slack messages with customer cards](/customer-cards), [set labels](/labels) and priorities, [create Linear tickets](/integrations/linear), and much more.

Here’s how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your workspaces">
- In Plain, navigate to **`Settings`** > **`Slack`**.
- Press **`Connect to Slack`**.
- Follow Slack’s instructions to make sure the correct Slack workspace is selected.
- Authorize replies from your Slack profile to respond directly from Plain.
</Step>
<Step title="Add the Plain app to the channels you want to track">

Once you’ve set up the integration in Plain, go to the Slack channels you want to track and invite the Plain app. You can do this by typing **`/invite`**, selecting **`Add apps to this channel`** and then choosing Plain.

<Warning>
  When Plain is added to a channel, we automatically classify it as a Customer channel if it's a _Slack Connect_ channel or one for [internal discussions](/thread-discussions) otherwise.

For customer channels, we treat messages from non-Plain users as support requests, which are ingested as threads into Plain.

In discussion channels, on the other hand, we only ingest messages related to an on-going discussion.

</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Try it out">

Slack messages from the authorized channels will begin appearing as threads in Plain. To respond, press `R` and begin typing in Plain. Your responses will appear in Slack as if you are responding directly in the app.

Emojis ( **`:`** to search for the right one), syntax highlighting, and attachments are all supported in Plain.

**Note -** Slack messages sent by a Slack user that does **not** have an account in Plain (i.e. a customer) will create threads in Plain.
