**The most powerful Slack integration for B2B support teams.**&#x20;

Our Slack integration lets you sync messages from selected Slack channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform. Get the full picture of your Slack support with robust [reporting](https://www.plain.com/docs/reporting), link customer requests from Slack to tickets in [Linear](https://www.plain.com/docs/integrations/linear) or [Jira](https://www.plain.com/docs/integrations/jira), and set [labels](https://www.plain.com/docs/labels), [tiers](https://www.plain.com/docs/tiers), and [SLAs](https://www.plain.com/docs/tiers#slas) – so you never miss a customer message again.&#x20;

You can also use AI-powered [suggested responses](https://www.plain.com/docs/plain-ai/suggested-responses), to draft responses to customer requests based off your documentation or knowledge base.&#x20;

Here’s how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your workspaces">
    * In Plain, navigate to **`Settings`** > **`Slack`**.

    * Press **`Connect to Slack`**.

    * Follow Slack’s instructions to make sure the correct Slack workspace is selected.

    * Authorize replies from your Slack profile to respond directly from Plain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Plain app to the channels you want to track">
    Once you’ve set up the integration in Plain, go to the Slack channels you want to track and invite the Plain app. You can do this by typing **`/invite`**, selecting **`Add apps to this channel`** and then choosing Plain.

    <Note>If you'd like to add Plain to many Slack channels in bulk, reach out via chat or on <a href="mailto:help@plain.com">help@plain.com</a> and we can help.</Note>

    <Warning>
      When Plain is added to a channel, we automatically classify it as a Customer channel if it's a *Slack Connect* channel or one for [internal discussions](/thread-discussions) otherwise.

      For customer channels, we treat messages from non-Plain users as support requests, which are ingested as threads into Plain.

      In discussion channels, on the other hand, we only ingest messages related to an on-going discussion.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try it out">
    Slack messages from the authorized channels will begin appearing as threads in Plain. To respond, press `R` and begin typing in Plain. Your responses will appear in Slack as if you are responding directly in the app.

    Emojis ( **`:`** to search for the right one), syntax highlighting, and attachments are all supported in Plain.

    **Note -** Slack messages sent by a Slack user that does **not** have an account in Plain (i.e. a customer) will create threads in Plain.
