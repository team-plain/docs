**Never miss another message from a customer in Slack**

Our Slack integration lets you sync messages from selected Slack channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

You will also be able to [add context to Slack messages with customer cards](/customer-cards), [set labels](/labels) and priorities, [create Linear tickets](/linear), and much more.

Hereâ€™s how to get started:

**1 Connect your workspaces**

- In Plain, navigate toÂ **`Settings`**Â >Â **`Slack`**.
- PressÂ **`Connect to Slack`**.
- Follow Slackâ€™s instructions to make sure the correct Slack workspace is selected.
- Authorize replies from your Slack profile to respond directly from Plain.

**2 Add the Plain app to the channels you want to track**

Once youâ€™ve set up the integration in Plain, go to the Slack channels you want to track and invite the Plain app. You can do this by typingÂ **`/invite`**, selectingÂ **`Add apps to this channel`**Â and then choosing Plain.

**3 Start responding ðŸ’¬**

Slack messages from the authorized channels will begin appearing as threads in Plain. To respond, press `R` and begin typing in Plain. Your responses will appear in Slack as if you are responding directly in the app.

Emojis ( **`:`** to search for the right one), syntax highlighting, and attachments are all supported in Plain.

**Note -** Slack messages sent by a Slack user that does **not** have an account in Plain (i.e. a customer) will create threads in Plain.
