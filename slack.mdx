**Never miss another message from a customer in Slack**

Our Slack integration lets you sync messages from selected Slack channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

You will also be able to [add context to Slack messages with customer cards](/customer-cards), [set labels](/labels) and priorities, [create Linear tickets](/integrations/linear), and much more.

Here's how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your workspaces">
- In Plain, navigate to **`Settings`** > **`Slack`**.
- Press **`Connect to Slack`**.
- Follow Slack's instructions to make sure the correct Slack workspace is selected.
- Authorize replies from your Slack profile to respond directly from Plain.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Plain app to the channels you want to track">
Once you've set up the integration in Plain, go to the Slack channels you want to track and invite the Plain app. You can do this by:
1. Typing **`/invite`** in the channel
2. Selecting **`Add apps to this channel`**
3. Choosing Plain from the app list

<Warning>
  When Plain is added to a channel, we automatically classify it as a Customer channel if it's a _Slack Connect_ channel or one for [internal discussions](/thread-discussions) otherwise.

For customer channels, we treat messages from non-Plain users as support requests, which are ingested as threads into Plain.

In discussion channels, we only ingest messages related to an ongoing discussion.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Try it out">
Slack messages from the authorized channels will begin appearing as threads in Plain. To respond:

1. Press `R` to begin typing in Plain
2. Compose your message
3. Send the response, which will appear in Slack as if you responded directly in Slack

The following features are fully supported:
- Emojis (press **`:`** to search)
- Syntax highlighting
- File attachments

<Note>
Slack messages sent by users who do not have a Plain account (i.e., customers) will create new threads in Plain.
