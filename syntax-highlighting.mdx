Within Plain, you can quickly and easily share code with customers using full syntax highlighting for all common languages.

In a message use 3 backticks ` ``` ` to start a code block and then press **Shift** and **Enter** (or just **Enter** 3 times) to exit the code block.

The language will be automatically inferred but if you want to override this you can manually specify the syntax after the initial 3 back-ticks. For example:

````
```json
{ "status": 200}
```
````

will render:

```json
{ "status": 200 }
```

<Warning>Syntax highlighting is **currently** only supported in email.</Warning>
