With contact forms, you can pre-triage every support request so that you know exactly what to prioritize in Plain.

Plain **does not** provide any UI components or a drop-in script tag. Instead, you use your own UI components and then use Plain's API.

When a contact form is submitted, you first [create the customer in Plain](/api-reference/graphql/customers/upsert) and then [create a thread](/api-reference/graphql/threads/create) in Plain.

Depending on your desired behavior, you can also do other things as part of the form submission, such as [add the customer to a customer group](/api-reference/graphql/customers/customer-groups), [set labels](/labels), and add a priority to a thread. Contact forms can take any shape and be very specific to your product and customers.

Here are just a few examples as starting points for you to customize:

### Example floating contact form

This shows how you can build a very simple floating contact form (bottom right) in NextJS.

### Example advanced contact form

This shows a more advanced contact form in NextJS with structured inputs depending on the topic you are getting in touch about and categorization.
