Labels are a lightweight and powerful way to categorize threads in Plain.

We recommend categorizing threads into topics so you immediately know, at a glance, what people are getting in touch about.

For example:
- "Bug report"
- "Sales" or "Demo request"
- "Feedback" or "Feature requests"
- "API question"
- "Security"
- "Hiring"
- etc.

In combination with setting thread priorities, labels can unlock powerful workflows and let you quickly triage your threads to work on what matters most, first.

To configure your labels, press ⌘ + K and search for "Manage labels" or go to **Settings** → **Labels**. Here you can define the icon and name your labels.

A thread can have multiple labels. They are displayed throughout the Plain UI wherever threads are visible.

In many cases, it's also useful to add labels to threads programatically.
