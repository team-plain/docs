*Chat is currently in Beta. This will not effect the reliability of this feature but we are heavily iterating and improving on the featureset.*

Our Chat widget lets you embed a live chat interface on your website or app, allowing your customers to reach out to you without leaving your site. You can then respond to these messages directly from Plain.

You and the customer can communicate in real-time and provide high fidelity support including syntax highlighting and rich-text formatting.

Here’s how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Chat app">
  *At the moment you can only create a single Chat app configuration per workspace. In future we will allow multiple configurations.*
  - In Plain, navigate to **`Settings`** > **`Chat`**.
  - Press **`Create Chat App`**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Chat to your webpage(s)">
  After creating your Chat app, you will be provided with a snippet of code that you can embed in your website or app. This will add the chat widget to your site. We recommend adding this to all pages of your site.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your Chat experience">
  You can customize some aspects of the Chat widget by providing additional information to the `Plain.init` function. These are the available options:
    <Snippet file="chat/customization.mdx" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Viewing Chats in Plain">
  Each new conversation in the Chat widget creates a new thread in Plain. You can view and respond to these threads in the Plain app.
</Step>
</Steps>
