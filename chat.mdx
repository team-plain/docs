_Chat is currently in Beta. This will not effect the reliability of this feature but we are heavily iterating and improving on the featureset._

Our Chat widget lets you embed a live chat interface on your website or app, allowing your customers to reach out to you without leaving your site. You can then respond to these messages directly from Plain.

You and the customer can communicate in real-time and provide high fidelity support including syntax highlighting and rich-text formatting.

Here’s how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Chat app">
    In Plain, navigate to **`Settings`** > **`Chat`**. 
    Press **`Create a Chat App`**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Chat to your webpage(s)">
    After creating your Chat app, you will be provided with a snippet of code that you can embed in
    your website or app. This will add the chat widget to your site. We recommend adding this to all
    pages of your site.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your Chat experience">
    You can customize some aspects of the Chat widget by providing additional information to the
    `Plain.init` function. [Learn more about customization here](/chat/customization).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add conditional auto-responses">
    You can add conditional auto-responses to chat by heading to the "auto-responses" section of
    your workplace settings. Set conditions based on tier or business hours, and let your customers
    know when they'll receive a response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Viewing Chats in Plain">
    Each new conversation in the Chat widget creates a new thread in Plain. You can view and respond
    to these threads in the Plain app.
  </Step>
</Steps>
