You can use workflow rules to help you automate your team's processes.

Some common use-cases include:
 * Assign someone to handle all inquiries from a given company or for your Enterprise tier
 * Assign a higher priority on a thread if it has a given label 
 * Assign a specific label on a thread if it contains certain keywords ([Plain AI](/plain-ai) can also add labels for you)

To manage your workflow rules go to **Settings** → **Workflow Rules**.

When building a new rule, you can choose among a set of **conditions** which result in one or more **actions**.

There are a couple of conditions you can choose from, based on the thread's attributes:
 * a given label is applied
 * is from a given company
 * is from a given slack channel
 * has a specific tier (ie Enterprise)
 * is for a specific support address (ie sales@yourcompany.com)
 * contains a certain keyword (ie vulnerability)

When the chosen condition matches a thread, you can perform one of the following actions:
 * assign someone to the thread
 * set the thread priority
 * apply a given label
