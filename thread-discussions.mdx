<Frame>![Example Thread Discussion](/public/images/discussions-introduction.png)</Frame>

Thread discussions allow you to discuss support requests with your team in Slack.

To start a discussion you can copy a link to a thread in Plain and share it in a Slack channel.

We will then unfurl the link for you and populate the Plain thread context for your wider team to be aware of, without leaving Slack.
For your convenience, the discussion will also be visible in the Plain thread.

To enable this functionality, you will need to setup your [Slack integration](/slack) first.

For good data hygiene, we don't start discussions on all links to a Plain thread.
We will not start a discussion if:

- the link is posted by someone who is not a user in Plain
- the link is posted in a private channel Plain doesn't have access to
- the link is posted in a Slack Connect channel

If you want to opt out of unfurling completely, you can disable thread discussions and link unfurling in your Slack integration settings.
