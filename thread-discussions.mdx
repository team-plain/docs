<Info>
  Slack Discussions are available on the [Grow pricing plan](https://www.plain.com/pricing) and above.

  If you are interested in trying this feature, please reach out to us at sales@plain.com or via our shared Slack channel.
</Info>

Slack discussions allow you to lead conversations with your team about support requests in Slack.

To start a discussion you can either do it from within the thread in Plain or simply copy & paste the thread link to that channel.

We will then unfurl the link for you and populate the Plain thread context for your wider team to be aware of, without leaving Slack.
For your convenience, the discussion will also be visible in the Plain thread.

Any messages you or your team sends on the slack thread will show up in Plain, along with their reactions, mentions and attachments. You can respond either via Slack or directly through Plain.

When a discussion is started, Plain will post a message with a "Resolve discussion" button. That can be used by anyone to signal that the discussion is concluded and the Plain thread will be moved back to the "Close the loop" status – nudging your team to update the customer.

To enable this functionality, you will need to setup your [Slack integration](/slack) and add the Plain bot to your channel.

<Warning>
  When Plain is added to a channel, we automatically classify it as a [Customer channel](/slack) if it's a *Slack Connect* channel or one for internal discussions otherwise.

  For customer channels, we treat messages from non-Plain users as support requests, which are ingested as threads into Plain.

  In discussion channels, on the other hand, we only ingest messages related to an on-going discussion.
</Warning>

For good data hygiene, we don't start discussions on all links to a Plain thread.
We will not start a discussion if:

* the link is posted by someone who is not a user in Plain.

* the link is posted in a private channel Plain doesn't have access to.

* the link is posted in a customer channel (typically *Slack Connect*), although you can always adjust this from your Slack settings.

If you want to opt out completely, you can disable Slack discussions and link unfurling in your Slack integration settings.
