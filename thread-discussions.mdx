<Frame>![Example Thread Discussion](/public/images/thread-discussion.png)</Frame>

Thread discussions allow you to lead side conversations for any thread with your wider team.

Simply get the link to the thread in Plain and paste it into any of your internal slack channels.

We will then unfurl the link for you and populate the Plain thread context for your wider team to be aware of, without leaving Slack.
What's more, the discussion will be visible in the Plain thread as well.

To enable this functionality, you will need to setup your [Slack integration](/slack) first.

Additionally, we don't start discussions on all links to a Plain thread.
In order to keep your customer data private, we will not start a discussion if:

- the link is posted by a non-Plain user
- the link is posted in a private channel Plain doesn't have access to
- the link is posted in a Slack Connect channel

Finally, you can always disable thread discussions and link unfurling by modifying your Plain Slack settings.
