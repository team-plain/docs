Every thread has a priority. Priorities help you manage your support queue and identify which threads need attention first.

The available priorities are:

- **Urgent**
- **High**
- **Medium**
- **Low**

When you are viewing a thread you can use the shortcut **P** to set the priority or use **âŒ˜ + K**.

When looking at your thread queue you can also filter and sort your threads by priority.

Priorities can be useful in combination with contact forms. By asking questions such as "is this preventing you from using X?" you can determine whether bug reports or questions are high priority.

Equally, you can automatically set higher priorities for certain topics like security reports, if your contact form exposes a topic picker.
