title: How long does it take to set up Plain? Do I need to have someone technical do it for me?
---

If you are setting up Plain to handle your Slack support it only takes a few minutes. You have to add a Slack app to your workspace and then invite Plain to the channels you want to handle.

The Plain App will walk you throught this process or we can help you onboard in a quick 15 minute call.

If you want to set-up Plain via email you need a bit more time and need to be able to add DNS records to your domain. For more info on how to set up email, [read the docs](/email).
