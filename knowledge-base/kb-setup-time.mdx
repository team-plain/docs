title: How long does it take to set up Plain? Do I need to have someone technical do it for me?

If you are setting up Plain to handle your Slack support it only takes a few minutes. You have to add a Slack app to your workspace and then invite Plain to the channels you want to handle. For detailed instructions [read the docs](/slack).

The Plain App will walk you throught this process or we can help you onboard in a quick 15 minute call.

If you want to set-up Plain via email you need a bit more time and need to be able to add DNS records to your domain. For more info on how to set up email, [read the docs](/email).
