title: Can I connect my personal email address to Plain?
---

Technically you can connect any email to Plain if you control the domain (e.g. not @hotmail.com) but we don't recommend using a personal email. The reason for this is that emails are visible to all users of Plain in your workspace. 

Visibility aside, we are focused on providing support via email and so Plain is not well suited for personal email address workflows.
