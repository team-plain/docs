title: Can I forward emails to Plain?
---

No. If you receive an email to your personal email address and would like to hand it off to support what you can do is **CC** your support email. 

For example, if help@acme.com is your support email and your email exchange could look like this:

---

**From**: jane@gmail.com<br/>
**To**: You<br/>

> Can you help me with A, B & C.

---

**From**: You<br/>
**To**: jane@gmail.com<br/> 
**Cc**: help@acme.com 👈<br/>

> Hey Jane, sure thing. Just looping in our support team here (CCd) who can help you out!
