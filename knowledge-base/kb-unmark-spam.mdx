title: How do I unmark a customer as spam?
---

When you mark a customer as spam you will no longer see their threads in the queue in Plain and they will not be included in reporting. 

You can see a list of all the customers you've marked as spam on the spam settings page at `Settings > Spam`.

To unmark a customer as spam, simply click the `Unmark as spam` button next to their name.
