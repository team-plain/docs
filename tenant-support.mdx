<br />

In Plain, in addition to [company support](/company-support), you can also organise your customers to mirror how your product is structured.

For example, if in your product all of your customers belong to a team/org/account/workspace then you would create a tenant per team/org/account/workspace.

Tenants are primarily useful if you are a larger support team building a headless support portal or if you have support SLAs tied to different tiers of customers.

Tenants are created and set [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/tenants/).
