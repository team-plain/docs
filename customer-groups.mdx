Groups let you organise customers when company, tenant or tiers don't make sense. A good example of this is when someone is beta tester or an investor trying your tool.

You can configure the groups in your workspace by going to **Settings** â†’ **Customer Groups**, where you can set a name and color per group.

You can then either manually add a customer to a group from any thread, or you can programmatically [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/customers/customer-groups).

You can also filter threads by customer groups, so you can, for example, prioritize threads belonging to beta testers.
