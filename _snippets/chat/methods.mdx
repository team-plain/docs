```typescript
// This takes the same arguments as Plain.init. It will update the chat widget in-place with the new configuration.
// Only top-level fields are updated, nested fields are not merged.
Plain.update({ ... });

// This takes the same arguments as `customerDetails` in Plain.init.
// This will update just the customer details in the chat widget. This may be useful if you have asynchronous authentication state
Plain.setCustomerDetails({ ...})

// Opens and closes the widget if using the default, floating mode
Plain.open();
Plain.close();

// These are event listeners that will be fired when the chat widget is opened or closed respectively
// These return a function that can be called to remove the listener
Plain.onOpen(() =>{ 
  // Opened
});
Plain.onClose(() => {
  // Closed
});

// Returns whether or not the chat widget is initialized
Plain.isInitialized();

// This returns an array with debug logs that have been collected by the chat widget
// This is useful if you are contacting Plain support with an issue regarding the chat widget
// This will redact sensitive information such as customer details
Plain.exportDebugLogs();
```
