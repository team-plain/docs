### What's the difference between companies and tenants?

Companies are typically a human concept which although useful for support has no corresponding entity in your database. Tenants on the other hand should 1:1 correspond with your tenants in your product/database.

So, for example, if within your product a user can be part of multiple workspaces then a customer could have the company "Acme" and also be part of two tenants such as: "acme_prod" and "acme_dev" (or "acme_marketing" and "acme_sales" etc.).
