title: 'Sending emails'

To be able to send emails from Plain using your support email address, you will need to add a couple of DNS records to your domain.

While setting up your email, you will see DNS settings that need to be
configured for your domain:

The first record is the "DKIM". It is part of the available mechanisms that exist to authenticate
emails: verifying that you're the actual sender of the email.

The second record sets the return path for emails sent from Plain using your domain.
Return paths are used if an email bounces (fails to reach an inbox).

Both of them make sure that your emails reach your users' email inboxes
and do not end up in the spam folder.

Adding these to your DNS records varies slightly among different
providers. Here is how to do so for some common hosting providers:

to propagate. For modern providers this should be less than 10 minutes,
but in extreme scenarios it may take 24-48 hours.
