In Plain all support requests are organised in threads, and every thread has a status.

This page explains each status, its purpose and best practices for how each fits into your workflow.

## Needs First Response

<Frame>![Todo / Needs First Response](/public/images/statuses/todo-needs-first-response.png)</Frame>

When a thread is first created it will be in this status. This means that the customer has never received a reply. If you have [First Response Time SLAs](/tiers#slas) set up, then this is the status they apply to.

## Needs Next Response

<Frame>![Todo / Needs Next Response](/public/images/statuses/todo-needs-next-response.png)</Frame>

When you reply to a customer support requests will automatically move to this status. If you have [Next Response Time SLAs](/tiers#slas) set up, then this is the status they apply to.

A thread will move to this status every time the customer responds to the thread.

## Investigating

<Frame>![Todo / Investigating](/public/images/statuses/todo-investigating.png)</Frame>

When you have a support request that requires further investigation or work on your side you can set a thread to this status.

This is particularly useful when you have support request that requires longer technical investigation or research before getting back to the customer or marking it as done.

## Close the Loop

<Frame>![Todo / Close the Loop](/public/images/statuses/todo-close-the-loop.png)</Frame>

If you use our [Linear Integration](/integrations/linear) then threads will move to this status when there was an update to a linked Linear issue.

## Waiting for Customer

<Frame>

</Frame>

Threads in this status are waiting for the customer to reply. By default, threads will be automatically moved to this status when you reply to them. You can change this setting in **Settings** → **Workflow**.

When a customer replies, threads in this status will be moved to Needs Next Response.

## Paused for Later

<Frame>![Snoozed / Paused for Later](/public/images/statuses/snoozed-paused-for-later.png)</Frame>

When you need to pick up a thread later, you can pause it for any amount of time. Once paused, threads will have this status.

When the pause duration you set runs out, or if the customer sends a new message, the thread will be moved back to its previous status.

## Done

<Frame>![Done](/public/images/statuses/done.png)</Frame>

When a customer issue is resolved, you can mark a thread as done. If a customer sends a new message the thread will move back to Needs Next Response.

## Ignored

<Frame>![Ignored](/public/images/statuses/ignored.png)</Frame>

When a thread in Plain is actually not a support request and can be ignored, you can ignore it. This will silence further notifications and status changes.

This is useful when there are non-support conversations (e.g. sales, social) happening in Slack channels where you provide support.
