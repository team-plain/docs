<Frame>![Company support within Plain](/public/images/companies-introduction.png)</Frame>

In Plain you can see what company a customer belongs to, so you have more context when providing support.

The company is automatically set based on the email domain of the customer and is visible throughout the support app. For example if a customer has the email with the domain **@nike.com** then their company will be **Nike**.

You can browse threads by company in Plain as well as associate a company with a tier to manage their SLAs.

Companies can also be listed and updated [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/companies/).
