Setting up email requires you to complete two steps:

  <Card title="Receiving emails in Plain" icon="inbox-in" href="https://plain.support.site/article/receiving-emails"></Card>
  <Card title="Sending emails from Plain" icon="paper-plane-top" href="https://plain.support.site/article/sending-emails"></Card>
</CardGroup>

If you follow this guide, bear in mind that:

- All emails sent to that email address will be received by Plain (not your email provider's inbox)
- You can only use one domain per Plain workspace but can use multiple emails for the same domain.

If you need to receive a copy of each email sent to the support email address (for instance, to keep a copy in your
company's email inbox), there are ways to achieve this. Please get in touch with us by email
at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com), and we will be happy to help.

## What you will need

- Your Plain workspace's inbound email address (which ends with
  `@inbound.postmark.app`). We will provide this during the email setup process.
- Admin access to your domain's DNS settings.
- Admin access to your company's email provider.
  - If you use Google for email, you will need admin access to the Google Workspace Admin console.

## What makes a good support email address?

The only requirement is that your support email address uses your company's domain. Email addresses using `@gmail.com`
, `@yahoo.com`, `@icloud.com`, `@hotmail.com` or any other public email provider **are not supported**.

We recommend you choose an email address that is easy to remember and clear that it represents a company. Good
examples could be `help@`, `support@`, `contact@` or `hello@`. Generally, we'd advise against a personal one
like `sonia@` or `peter@` but they might also be fine, depending on your needs.
