Setting up email requires you to complete two steps:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Receiving emails in Plain" icon="inbox-in" href="/email/receiving"></Card>
  <Card title="Sending emails from Plain" icon="paper-plane-top" href="/email/sending"></Card>
</CardGroup>

When following this guide, please note:

- All emails sent to your support email address will be received by Plain (not your email provider's inbox)
- You can only use one domain per Plain workspace but can use multiple email addresses for the same domain

If you need to receive a copy of each email sent to the support email address (for instance, to keep a copy in your
company's email inbox), we can help set this up. Please reach out to us at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com).

## What you will need

- Your Plain workspace's inbound email address (which ends with
  `@inbound.postmark.app`). We will provide this during the email setup process.
- Admin access to your domain's DNS settings
- Admin access to your company's email provider
  - For Google Workspace users, you will need admin access to the Google Workspace Admin Console

## What makes a good support email address?

The only requirement is that your support email address uses your company's domain. Email addresses using `@Gmail.com`,
`@Yahoo.com`, `@iCloud.com`, `@Hotmail.com`, or any other public email provider are **not supported**.

We recommend choosing an email address that is easy to remember and clearly represents your company. Good
examples include `help@`, `support@`, `contact@`, or `hello@`. Generally, we advise against using personal addresses
like `sonia@` or `peter@`, though these might be suitable depending on your needs.
