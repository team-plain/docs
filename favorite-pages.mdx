You can favorite pages in your workspace to organize your support queue, and stay focused on the threads you need to.

Favorite pages are really helpful for account managers who need to keep a close eye on support requests from the customers they manage, and support teams where different customers get a different level of service (e.g. free and enterprise plans). 

To favorite a saved view that was created by someone else on your team, just head to “Views” in the left hand sidebar of your workspace, and hit the star icon on the ones you’d like to favorite. 

To favorite a company, tenant, label, group, or tier page – navigate to the individual page you’d like to save, and hit the star icon to add a page to your favorites. 

When you create your own saved views, they’ll automatically be saved to your favorite pages. You can un-favorite them easily by de-selecting the star icon.
