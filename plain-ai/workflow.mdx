**Auto-labelling**

When a thread is created, Plain AI will add 1-2 labels automatically to a thread based on its content. If a thread was created with existing labels, no labels will be added. To best leverage Plain AI, make sure you’ve already set up [Labels](/labels) (**Settings → Labels**).

**Thread titles**

When enabled, this will automatically give each thread a short, descriptive title based on the content of the support request. This is particularly useful in Slack and other channels which, unlike email, do not have a subject line you can rely on.

**Thread summarization**

As a thread grows over time, a summary of the thread will be added and kept up-to-date so you know what has happened without having to read the full timeline and every message. You can see the summary on the top right of any thread and in Slack notifications.

**Similar threads**

With this setting enabled, Plain AI will suggest similar threads in the thread details panel for the thread you’re currently viewing. This is useful to avoid duplicate work and to see if a similar issue has been resolved before.
