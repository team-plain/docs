title: 'Suggested Responses'

Suggested responses are shown for incoming support requests. The responses use information from past support requests and optionally your [Knowledge Sources](/plain-ai/knowledge-sources).

<Info>
  Suggested Responses are only available in our [Scale tier](https://plain.com/pricing). If you are
  interested in using this feature please reach out to use on
  [sales@plain.com](mailto:plain@sales.com).

To enable suggested responses go to **Settings** → **Plain AI** and toggle the suggested responses setting.

Once enabled, they will be visible in the composer, when a suggested response is available, which can then be brought into the composer, for editing or sending.


To index your documentation and add context for suggested responses, check out our [Knowledge sources documentation](/plain-ai/knowledge-sources).



Suggested responses can be hidden on a user level basis by clicking on your profile avatar in the bottom left of the screen and navigating to Preferences -> UI preferences.

Here a user can toggle the **Show suggested responses** setting, and when disabled, they will no longer appear in the thread view.
