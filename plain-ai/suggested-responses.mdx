To enable suggested responses go to **Settings** → **Plain AI** and toggle the suggested responses setting.

Once enabled, they will be visible in the composer, when a suggested response is available, which can then be brought into the composer, for editing or sending.


To index your documentation and add context for suggested responses, check out our [Knowledge sources documentation](/plain-ai/knowledge-sources).
