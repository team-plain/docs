With **AI Slash Commands** you now use AI directly within Plain to help you draft replies to customers faster.Â AI Slash Commands contain the context of the open support request. 

### **How It Works**

While writing in a thread, type **/** followed by an instruction to ask AI for help drafting or editing a message.

You can:

- Draft a new message
- Edit an existing message
- Add to what you've already written

### **Examples**

Here are some ideas to get started:

- `/fix typos`
- `/ask for a screenshot and workspace ID so we can debug`
- `/ask for version of SDK`

If your prompt doesn't relate to the customer conversation, it will return an error message.
