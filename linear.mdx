To easily keep track of feature requests and bugs reported in Plain, you can connect your Linear workspace with Plain.

This lets you easily link a Linear issue to a thread.

To do this, head to **Settings** â†’ **Linear integration** and connect your workspace.

Once this set-up is done, you can add a Linear issue from the right hand side of a thread or by pressing the shortcut `i`.

Once a Linear issue is linked, the thread will move back to `Todo` when the Linear issue is completed or cancelled.

This means that you can update customers when a bug or feature request that they reported has been fixed.
