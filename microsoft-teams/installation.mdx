   Microsoft Teams support is only available in our [Scale tier](https://www.plain.com/pricing). If you are interested in using this feature please reach out to use on [sales@plain.com](mailto:sales@plain.com).

Our Microsoft Teams integration lets you sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

### Prerequisites

For the integration you'll need:

- A Teams account with at least one seat
- The installation of the app for Teams can only be performed by an admin as you may need to change settings to:
- [Allow external apps to be installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/external-app-setup?view=o365-worldwide)
- [Allow external users to be added as guests to be invited to Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team)

## Using the Plain app in Microsoft Teams

The Plain app must be added to a Team and channel that allows guests where you can provide customer support. To start helping customers, you need to do a few things:

<Warning>
    If the app was installed via the Teams admin dashboard, it can take upto 24 hours to appear in the
    Teams client
</Warning>

- Create a new Team
- Create a new channel in the Team
- Add the Plain app to the Channel (see below)
- [Invite guests to the channel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/add-guests-to-a-team-in-microsoft-teams-fccb4fa6-f864-4508-bdde-256e7384a14f)

## How threads are created from Teams

You should now have a channel with the Plain app installed, with _users_ and _guests_. The integration works as follows

- Only posts **created by guests** will create a new thread in Plain
- Reply messages to threads **created by guests** will be ingested by both **users and guests**

## Responding to customers

To respond to customers, you can do so directly from the Plain app in Teams.

If the user has a personal Teams integration (see below) then the message will be sent as that user:

![User Reply](/public/images/ms-teams-int-user-reply.png)

If the user does not have a personal Teams integration, we will send the message as the bot, impersonating the user, which will look like the below:

![Impersonated Reply](/public/images/ms-teams-int-impersonated-reply.png)

## Authorize Teams users in Plain

Its recommended that anyone with a Teams seat follows the below steps to allow Plain to reply as their teams user. It also allows attributing any messages they send in the Teams channel to be associated with their Plain user.

To link a Teams account with a Plain user account, navigate to  **`Settings`** > **`Microsoft Teams`** and click, **`Authorise replies`** to start the authorization flow.
