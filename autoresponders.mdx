title: 'Autoresponders'
---

To set up an autoresponder go to **Settings** â†’ **Autoresponder**

An autoresponder can be useful in situations of acute support load, such as during incidents, or to confirm you received a support request and manage expectations with customers.

Autoresponder messages are best kept short and personable without too many links or formatting. Messages which are too long and scripted will often just be ignored as they are too obviously automated.

<Warning>
  Please be aware that autresponders are not yet supported for threads created via Slack.
