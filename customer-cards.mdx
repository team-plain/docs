Customer cards are a powerful feature in Plain that allows you to show information from your own systems while looking at a customer in Plain. This ensures that you always have important context at your fingertips when helping customers, without having to jump through different tabs and admin tools.

Customer cards are:

- Pulled from your backend, so you do not have to sync your customer data to Plain.
- Short-lived, so no data is permanently stored in Plain beyond the time frame you set.
- Defined using a simple JSON schema, so you don't have to worry about styling them.
- Automatically reloaded if a user is viewing a customer and the data expires.
